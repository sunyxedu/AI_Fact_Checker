# Fact Checking and Voice Recognition

## Overview
This project integrates voice recognition with fact-checking capabilities to convert speech to text, verify the accuracy of statements using multiple sources, and present the findings in a mind map format.

## Features
- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts spoken words into written text using advanced voice recognition technology.
- **Fact-Checking**: Verifies the accuracy of transcribed statements by cross-referencing multiple reliable sources.
- **Data Presentation**: Organizes fact-checking results in an interactive mind map for better visualization and understanding.

## How It Works
1. **Voice Input**: The user speaks into the system.
2. **Speech-to-Text Processing**: The system transcribes the speech into text.
3. **Fact Verification**: The transcribed text is checked against multiple sources for accuracy.
4. **Mind Map Generation**: Verified data and insights are visually structured in a mind map format.

## Technologies Used
- **Voice Recognition**: Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper AI, or any other suitable library.
- **Fact-Checking API**: OpenAI, Google Fact Check Tools, or other reliable databases.
- **Mind Map Visualization**: D3.js, MindMeister API, or custom visualization techniques.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sunyxedu/AI_Fact_Checker
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   see file DEPENDENCIES
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python runner.py
   ```

## Usage
- Start the application and use voice commands to input statements.
- The system will process and verify the information.
- View results as a structured mind map.
